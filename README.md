# React-App
This is my first project where I am using a very popular library called react
Here I am creating an web application that is prototype of a shopping cart page of an e-commerce website
The steps involved in creating this application are:
1.Install a package by name create-react-app using npm(node package manager) by typing following command in either windows or mac machine: npm i create-react-app
2.Now we have to create react application by using (create-react-app counter-app) command in command prompt (or) terminal.
3.After complition of second step you will have a folder by name counter-app in your root directory which contains all the files including an server file and it also launches a server at localhost:3000 in your default browser
4.Further in this react application we can include other things like bootstrap to make it more modern one,
I am still working on this application and soon will upload the complete project files to this repository.


Happy Coding....
